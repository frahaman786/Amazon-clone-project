 Amazon-clone-project
I have successfully built an Amazon clone using only HTML and CSS in just three days. This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of core web design principles, including the box model, padding, margin, and text properties. 

Features:
- Home Page: A visually appealing and responsive home page with a header, search bar, and product listings.
- *Product Listings:* Detailed product pages that mimic Amazon's layout and design.
- *Responsive Design:* Ensures a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
  
 Tech Stack:
- HTML: Structuring the content.
- CSS: Styling and layout.

Highlights:
- Built from scratch without using any JavaScript or backend technologies.
- Focused on replicating the design and user interface of Amazon's website.

Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback!
